✅ Tic-Tac-Toe Game — Description
This is a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The game allows two players to play against each other by taking turns to mark O and X on a 3x3 grid.

Key Features:
✔️ Interactive Board:
Players click on boxes to place their mark (O or X).

✔️ Turn-Based Play:
The game automatically switches turns between Player O and Player X.

✔️ Color-Coded Marks:
The O symbols appear in a different color (e.g., blue) and the X symbols appear in another color (e.g., red) to clearly distinguish between players.

The game checks for all possible winning patterns after every move.
If a player wins, a congratulatory message displays the winner’s mark.

✔️ Draw Detection:
If all boxes are filled and no one wins, the game announces a draw.

Players can start a New Game or Reset the current game at any time using the buttons provided.

✔️ Simple, Responsive Design:
The layout is clean and adapts to different screen sizes using flexbox and vmin units.
